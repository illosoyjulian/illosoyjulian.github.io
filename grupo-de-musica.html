        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>Rivers of Nihil was formed in 2009. They recorded their first EP Hierarchy later that year with Century vocalist Carson Slovak, who produced numerous works by other bands such as August Burns Red, Texas in July, and Black Crown Initiate (Slovak would later work with the bands on their second and third studio albums, adding writing credits to "Terrestria III: Wither" on Where Owls Know My Name).[4] During this period the band opened shows for bands such as Decapitated, Decrepit Birth, Suffocation, Dying Fetus, and Misery Index.</p>

<p>In 2011 the band worked with producer Len Carmichael to record their second EP Temporality Unbound. The album would spawn a music video for the song "(sin)Chronos".</p>

<p>In February 2012, MetalSucks referred to Rivers of Nihil as the "best new Death metal band you'll hear this year".</p>

<p>On December 10, 2012, Metal Blade Records announced that they'd signed Rivers of Nihil to a record deal, and released a demo for the song "Rain Eater". The label also announced that the band would be working with Erik Rutan of Hate Eternal and Morbid Angel to record their first studio album at Mana Recording Studios in Tampa, Florida. The band released the album in the United States on October 15, 2013. Album artwork was created by Dan Seagrave, who would handle the artwork on the band's next two albums as well.</p>

<p>Rivers of Nihil returned to Atrium studios to work again with Slovak on their second full-length studio album, Monarchy, which was released on August 21, 2015. The album sold 1,175 copies in its first week. On August 17, 2015, the band made Monarchy available for streaming in full.</p>

<p>On September 7, 2017, the band announced via their Facebook account that they'd returned to the studio, once again working at Atrium Audio, and working again with audio engineers Carson Slovak and Grant McFarland. The band recruited The Kennedy Veil's live drummer Jared Klein to track drums. On March 16, 2018, the band released Where Owls Know My Name as well as a music video for the song "A Home". Metal Injection gave the album a perfect 10/10 score.</p>
